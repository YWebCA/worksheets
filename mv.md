# Worksheet: `mv`

The `mv` command, while called "move," actually does two things.

## Move Things

Using your knowledge of `cp`, figure out how to move both files and directories.

> It's just like `cp`! The only difference is the original is not left behind.

## Rename Things

Using your current knowledge of `mv`, figure out how to rename files and
directories.

> It's just like `cp`!

## Why are moving things and renaming things the same thing?

> Because the file's full name (its path) is also its location. Also, location is an illusion. It's all names. Those files can be anywhere.
