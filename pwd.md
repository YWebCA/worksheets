# pwd

Just for fun, let's look at my default Terminal that was installed on my Mac
when I got it new.

## The Prompt

When I opened my terminal I was confronted with a prompt. Type that prompt
here:

> katamari-macbook/lulu $

What are the pieces of my prompt and what do they mean?

    katamari-macbook
> My computer's netowork name.

    /
> A divider.

    lulu
> My user name

    $
> The actual prompt.

The prompt is highly customizable, and that's exactly what OhMyZsh has done for
us. Let's go back to iTerm2. Isn't OhMyZsh's minimal and color-coded prompt
nice? ;)

In these worksheets we will show the prompt as `$`. You may or may not have a
dollar sign in your prompt, but that doesn't matter--this is just a convention.
When we show a prompt and some stuff to type afterward, you don't have to type
the prompt itself.

## Commands

The prompt is prompting you to give it commands. So let's give it one.

    $ pwd

The terminal should say something in response. Type that response here:

    /Users/LipGlossary

What does this response mean?

> It is my current working directory. It is "where I am" right now in this
> instance of the Terminal.

So what does `pwd` do? What does `pwd` stand for? (It's an acronym.)

> Print Working Directory. It prints the working directory.
